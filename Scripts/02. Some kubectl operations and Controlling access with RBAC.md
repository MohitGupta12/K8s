# Kubectl Operations

There are some task we have to perform in-order to complete this lab
- Get a List of Persistent Volumes Sorted by Capacity
- Run a Command Inside the `quark` Pod's Container to Obtain a Key Value
- Create a Deployment Using a Spec File
- Delete the `beebox-auth` Service

### Get a List of Persistent Volumes Sorted by Capacity

To make a file containing list of persistent volumes sorted by capacity  :

```
kubectl get pv
kubectl get pv -o yaml (To check where is capacity)
kubectl get pv --sort-by=.spec.capacity.storage
kubectl get pv --sort-by=.spec.capacity.storage > /home/cloud_user/pv_list.txt
```


### Run a Command Inside the `quark` Pod's Container to Obtain a Key Value

To get the contents of a file from inside the `quark` pod's container we can use **exec**
```
kubectl exec quark -n beebox-mobile \
-- cat /etc/key/key.txt > /home/cloud_user/key.txt
```

### Create a Deployment Using a Spec File

 To create a deployment using the deployment spec file, we can use **apply**

```
kubectl apply -f /home/cloud_user/deployment.yml
```

### Delete the `beebox-auth` Service

To delete any pod or service we can use **delete** and give its type and name to it :

```
kubectl delete service beebox-auth-svc -n beebox-mobile
```


# Controlling Access in Kubernetes with RBAC

For this lab we have to make a role that can only read from a namespaces and bind it to a user dev

### Creating the Role 
  
```
nano pod-reader-role.yml
```

Spec file for role that can only read from beebox-mobile
   ```
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Role
    metadata:
      namespace: beebox-mobile
      name: pod-reader
    rules:
    - apiGroups: [""]
      resources: ["pods", "pods/log"]
      verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
   ```    

Creating the role:
```
kubectl apply -f pod-reader-role.yml
```


### Binding the Role to the `dev` User 

```
vi pod-reader-rolebinding.yml
```

Spec file for role-binding

```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: pod-reader
  namespace: beebox-mobile
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: dev
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

Creating the RoleBinding:

```
kubectl apply -f pod-reader-rolebinding.yml
```

If dev users used these command will not get any errors  
```
kubectl get pods -n beebox-mobile --kubeconfig dev-k8s-config
kubectl logs beebox-auth -n beebox-mobile --kubeconfig dev-k8s-config
```
using **dev-k8s-config** to act as a dev user

This will give error 
```
kubectl delete pod beebox-auth -n beebox-mobile --kubeconfig dev-k8s-config
```
